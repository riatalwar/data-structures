Since we are storing Students in this data structure, each item will be a unique student with a unique email. This automatically eliminates SparseIndexedList, as it is meant to store data that is mostly the same. In addition, this implementation will need to use binary search, so data should be kept in order. This means that, each time a Student is added or removed, the remaining portion of the list needs to be shifted by one index. This is highly expensive in an ArrayIndexedList, as each item will need to be copied into an adjacent box. However, in a LinkedIndexedList this operation is much simpler, as all it requires is unlinking and relinking one node. This makes it significantly less expensive to implement add and remove, and it retains an ordered structure so that it is still possible to apply binary search, making a LinkedIndexedList the best option for this purpose.
